# PumpkinPal
Made for SpookyJam 2023!

Adds a friendly pumpkin who has a deep history with The Warden. Pumpkin Pal will throw sculk pumpkin pies, which upon landing not only drop the item, but also gives nearby entiies a random potion effect! Eating a sculk pumpkin pie will give you some xp, which can be used to mend tools if you wish. Eating a sculk pumpkin pie while above level 30 will drop less xp, but still a decent amount to make your sculk pumpkin pie gathering worthwhile!

Available for both Forge and Fabric on Minecraft version 1.20.1!!!
Requires Architectury & Geckolib.
